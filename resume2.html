            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p><em>Welcome to my website. My name is Maisuly Olzhas. I was born on July 4, 1959, in Almaty and now I am 64 years old. I graduated from Lyceum 39 in 1977 and entered the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics at Moscow State University, where I graduated with honors in 1981.</em></p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>My professional career began in 1982, when I got a job at PROMBANK in the banking operations automation department. Over 9 years of work, I became the main specialist. While working at Prombank, I simultaneously completed a master's degree at Moscow State University in my specialty.</strong></p>
                <li>After the bank closed in 1991, I defended my doctoral dissertation in my specialty at Moscow State University and became a candidate of mechanical and mathematical sciences. Then I got a job as a teacher at Moscow State University. After 7 years of scientific and pedagogical work at Moscow State University, I became the dean of the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics and worked in this position for 3 years. After that, I again became a regular teacher and worked at Moscow State University until 2023.</p>
                <li>During my work, I wrote more than 100 scientific papers, received many awards and titles, including the title of Honored Worker of Science and Technology. I have always enjoyed reading, writing scientific reports, conducting research, and playing chess.</p>
                <li>Now I am retiring for a well-deserved retirement. I am proud of my achievements and glad that I can share them with you. On this site, you will find detailed information about my career, my projects, and achievements. I hope that my experience will be useful to you and inspire you to new achievements.</p>
